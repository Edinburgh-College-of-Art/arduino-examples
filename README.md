# arduino-examples
A collection of example sketches and function libraries for the arduino/adafruit novice

## About
This repository hopes to collect together some examples of code for Arduino that will be relevant to courses across ECA. There is a particular focus towards IoT device based operations as well as communicating with other environements like MaxMSP and Processing.

### examples
This folder is home to example projects and code snippets that aim to demonstrate how the Arduino operates using real world examples.

### library
This folder collects together a selection of header files that aim to simplify some operations. Copy these into your Arduino project and include them with a

```c
#include "HEADER_FILE.h"
```

line at the top of your script.

Once you feel more adventurous, you can go into these files and edit them to fit your own needs.
